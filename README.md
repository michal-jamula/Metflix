## Program Overview:

This is my attempt in making an "online streaming service". I don't have any formal or informal requirements. The idea is to start small and keep on expanding the functionality as I expand my knowledge and learn new concepts.
<br>

This website is a demonstration of my skills. I'm building the website with Bootstrap and basic HTML, CSS and JS.
For the backend I'm using Java, Spring, thymeleaf, hibernate, jpa and other related frameworks to make the website function.

<br>

The motivation for this project comes from the willingness to show off my skills and use them outside of the courses that I've completed. The point is to cement my knowledge and become more confident in using this technology.


<br><br>

## Features:
The program is designed to read and inject data dynamically. All functionality should work as expected (like the user registering, logging in, starting a subscription etc...)
A detailed list of features is still to be determined

<br><br>

Note: The program is not meant to represent optimal security measurements, Spring Security is planned to be implemented but (probably) there will be data flaws. 

<br><br>

## Future plans:
1. ~~Finish working on the basic HTML and CSS files. Aim to create a finished website look~~ Finished
2. ~~Clean up the HTML, CSS code, comment appropriately and get rid of useless code~~ Finished
3. Start a spring boot project and setup what i can (jpa entities with h2 database, thymeleaf, spring-boot server, controller etc) -- In progress
   1. ~~Create basic working website with dummy data~~
   2. Setup basic user functionality
   3. Setup movie watching functionality
   4. Setup admin pages functionality
4. Implement spring security to authorise and authenticate users
5. (maybe) Integrate paypal developer payment systems
6. (maybe) More to implement in the future

## Update History:
10/10/2022 HTML CSS mostly finished, looking like the end product is likely to look.
