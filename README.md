<br>

## Program Overview:

This website is a demonstration of my skills. I'm building the website with Bootstrap and basic HTML, CSS and JS.
For the backend I'm using Java, Spring, thymeleaf, hibernate, jpa and other related frameworks to make the website function as expected.

<br>

The motivation for this project comes from the willingness to show off my skills and use them outside of the courses that I've completed. The point is to cement my knowledge and become more confident in using this technology.


<br><br>

## Features:
The program is designed to read and inject data dynamically. All functionality should work as expected (like the user registering, logging in, starting a subscription etc...)
A detailed list of features is still to be determined

<br><br>

Note: The program is not meant to represent optimal security measurements, Spring Security is planned to be implemented but (probably) there will be data flaws. 

<br><br>

## Future plans:
1. ~~~Finish working on the basic HTML and CSS files. Aim to create a finished website look~~~ This part is mostly finished now
2. Clean up the HTML, CSS code, comment appropriately and get rid of useless code
3. Start a spring boot project and setup what i can (jpa entities with h2 database, thymeleaf, spring-boot server, controller etc)
4. Integrate everything together and make sure the basic functionality is there
5. Implement spring security to authorise and authenticate users
6. (maybe) Integrate paypal developer payment systems
7. (maybe) More to implement in the future
